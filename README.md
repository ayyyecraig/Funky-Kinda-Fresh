## Description
The anaerobic breakdown of molecules has been perfected for more than 10,000 years; in recent years it has ***bubbled*** up into Michelin starred kitchens like [Noma](https://noma.dk/), as well as the homes filled during the covid-19 lockdowns baking loafs of amzing sourdough. Being such delicate enviroments; they can easily harbor horrific smells, or give you a new spin on life (in some circles believed to treat cancer). That is where Funky Kinda Fresh comes in to assure your peace of mind and success in the amazing depths of fermentation. 

## Features
### Lets easily calculate and store any data of your ferments to keep a running diary of all the types of Sourdoughs you've created
- Need a percentage for your lacto ferment? We have you there. Quickly look into the different methods of fermentation to get your perfect salt brine ratio!
- Calculate how much you should feed your sourdough or injera starter! Give us details on the flour, the smells plus notes of flavor, and the end product!-- use this feature for any project ! Used salmon instead of makeral for garum ? How difficult was it to clarify ? You can look back on your journey and how you incorporated them into fantastic dishes.
----
### Lets just take a look at some simple Vinegars or any ferment
- Get quick descriptions, processes, and recipe percentages.
- Confirm and troubleshoot what went wrong with your ferment and if its safe to eat! (Hint: if it smells, let it go stale)

## Getting Started
I will be starting from the backend, building a server making sure I have something to display any data I will later be routing. From there I will make a 180 into the Front end building out the nav bar displaying 4 pages you can run throughout your visit. Then it is time to link the front and back before heading to the middleware and routes. 1.searching through different ferment recipes. 2. Gone bad ferments. 3. The ability to add your own recipes or delete. 4. A calculator for a sourdough feeder 
 Once a near fully functioning webpage has hit a resonably amount of MVP I will hope to style with a Farm to Table like experience and photos displaying beautiful nutrious probiotics.

## Technologies
* JavaScript
    * React
    * MongoDB, Mongoose
    * Express
* CSS/ Html 
* Grid or flexbox to display photos of active fermentations


### Future Projects
* Adding a calculator for any percentages needed
